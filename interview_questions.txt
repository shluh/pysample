How many executor will you assign for a 10GB (10240 MB) file in HDFS
---------------> default partition split size = 128 MB

1. find the number of partitions = 10240 MB /128 MB = 80 partitions
2. find the cpu cores for maximum parallelism =  80 CPU cores (we have 80 partitiond and need 80 cores for maximum  parallelism)
3. find the maximum allowed cpu cores for each executor = 5 Cores per executor for YARN (we r using HDFS so, we must use YARN resource management. for yarn cluster, the recomended max CPU cores are five)
4. number of executors = total cores/executor cores = 80(total cores)/5(executor cores) = 16  

Follow-up Question
How many cores are needed for each executor
5 cores per executor

What amount of memory is required for each executor?
---------------> default partition split size = 128 MB
1. Find the partition size = 128 MB
2. Assign a minimum of 4x memory for each core = 128 MB x 4 = 512 MB
3. Multiply it by executor cores to get executor memory = 512MB x 5 cores = 2560MB (minimum recomended memory by executor)
