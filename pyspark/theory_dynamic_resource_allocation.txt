spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled = true
spark.dynamicAllocation.shuffleTracking.enabled = true

spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout = 60s (controls the release time for an idle executor)
spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout = 1s (controls the request time for more executors. if having pending tasks for more than 1s and do not have any free executor, the application will ask more executors)


the resource manager has nothing to do with it
it is the spark application that will request and release resources when needed
