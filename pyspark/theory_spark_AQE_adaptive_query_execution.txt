Spark AQE

# dynamically coalescing shuffle partitions
    shuffle operations is critical for spark Performance
    one fundamental tuning property of shuffle operation is the number of output parttitions
        you can tune it using spark.shuffle.partitions
            small number of partitions cause    
                large partition size
                tasks needs large amount of memory
                may cause OOM exception
            
            large number of partitions cause
                small/tiny partitions size
                many network fetch causing inefficiente network I/O
                more burden for spark task scheduler
    the solution is enable AQE, that:
        determine and set teh best shuffle partitions number
        combine or coalesce the small partitions
    

# dynamically switching join strategies
    spark.sql.adaptive.localShuffleReader.enabled = true
    
    the custom shuffle reader is specially designed to further optimize the AQE broadcast join by reducing the network traffic.
    shuffle will be still there, cause the statics are calculated during the shuffle
    broadcast hash join will save the expensive sort operation
    
    requirements
        you can apply broadcast join if one side of the join can fit well in memory
        one table should be shorter than spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold 

    benefits
        AQE computes the table size at shuffle time
        replans the join strategy at runtime converting sort-merge join to a broadcast hash join
    
# dynamically optimizing skew joins
    will split the skewd partition, and duplicate the data on right join table
        spark.sql.adaptive.enable = true
        spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enable = true

        Spark will start the optimization ONLY of the two conditions below are met
        spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.skewedPartitionFactor = 5 (skewed partition is 5 time greater than the median partition size )
        spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.skewedPartitionThresholdInBytes = 256MB (partition it is considered skewd if the partition size is larger than XXX MB)
